# JavaScript Array Manipulation Project

## Student ID: [11013605]

## Project Overview
This project consists of a series of JavaScript functions that manipulate arrays and create user profiles based on provided input. The tasks include processing an array of numbers, formatting strings based on these processed numbers, and creating user profiles with the original and modified names.

## Tasks

### Task 1: processArray Function
- arrayManipulation.js
-  The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as input. It returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
arrayManipulation.js
- The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the `processArray` function. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
- userInfo.js
- The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of names and an array of modified names (processed by `formatArrayStrings`). It returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
